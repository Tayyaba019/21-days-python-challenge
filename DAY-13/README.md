# 🧭 Maze Solver – Day 13

This project is a visual maze solver using the Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm, built with Python's `curses` library.

---

## 🕹️ How It Works

- The maze is represented using a 2D list.
- `O` is the start point.
- `X` is the goal.
- The program finds the shortest path from start to end.
- The path is visualized step-by-step in the terminal.

## 🛠️ Requirements

- Python 3
- Compatible terminal (supports `curses`)

---

## ▶️ Run the Project

```bash
python path_finder.py
