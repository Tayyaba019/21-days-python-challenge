# ðŸ’± Currency Converter (Python CLI App)

This is a **Command-Line Currency Converter App** built with Python. It allows you to:

- List all available currencies and their exchange rates.
- Convert an amount from one currency to another.
- View the exchange rate between any two currencies.

The app fetches real-time data from the [ExchangeRate API](https://www.exchangerate-api.com/) and follows best practices like using a `.env` file for secure API key storage.
