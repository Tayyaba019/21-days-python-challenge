# Day 7 - Mad Libs Game 

This is a simple **Mad Libs game** that reads a text file containing placeholders and prompts the user to fill them in. Once all the placeholders are filled, the complete story is printed.

## How It Works

- Reads a story from `story.txt` containing placeholders like `<noun>`, `<verb>`, etc.
- Detects and extracts all unique placeholder words.
- Prompts the user to input values for each placeholder.
- Replaces placeholders with user inputs.
- Prints the completed story.
